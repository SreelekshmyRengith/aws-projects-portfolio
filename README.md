## About This Repository

This repository is a personal portfolio of AWS-focused projects created as part of my journey into cloud computing. As a cloud enthusiast, I'm exploring various AWS services and building hands-on projects to deepen my understanding of serverless architecture, infrastructure as code, automation, and more.

Each project in this collection is designed to be practical, beginner-friendly, and documented to help both myself and others learning alongside me.
